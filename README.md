# haskpy-dependency-graphs
An attempt to build Python dependency graphs in Haskell

## WORK IN PROGRESS
This application was inspired by two things: 
1. An interest in learning Haskell
2. A desire to map out dependencies in Python applications (and to find circular dependencies).

This project has just been started (and may not ever be completed), but in an effort to save current progress, it is being hosted here.
